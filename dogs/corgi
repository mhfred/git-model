The Pembroke Welsh Corgi (/ˈkɔːrɡi/; Welsh for dwarf dog) is a cattle herding dog breed which originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales.[1] It is one of two breeds known as a Welsh Corgi. The other is the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, and both descend from the line that is the northern spitz-type dog (examples include that of the Siberian Husky).[2] Another theory is that Pembrokes are descended from the Swedish Vallhunds, which were crossed with the local Welsh herding dogs.[3] The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is the younger of the two Corgi breeds and is a separate and distinct breed[4] from the Cardigan.[1] The corgi is one of the smallest dogs in the Herding Group. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are famed for being the preferred breed of Queen Elizabeth II, who has owned more than 30 during her reign.[5] These dogs have been favored by British royalty for more than seventy years, but among British Commoners, have recently fallen into decline in terms of popularity and demand.[6]
